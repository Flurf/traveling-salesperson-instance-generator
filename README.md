# flyingTravelingSalesman
Code developed in order to create instances for a Traveling Salesman problem.
The user can either choose to generate random geographical coordinates inside a reference area or defining them by hand. The code will then calculate the distance matrix and the times matrix using the Google Maps API. The coordinates and the matrixes will then be printed to text ready to be employed in whatever solver or custom code; since the outputs of this code were required to be implemented in AMPL, another file is printed in a .dat format. The random positions inside the reference area are additionaly plotted as a png image.
